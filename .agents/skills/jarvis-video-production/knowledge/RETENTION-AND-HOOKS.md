# Retention & Hooks — the Byrddynasty standard (READ FIRST when scripting)

This is the **canonical playbook** for how Byrddynasty ("Understanding AI") videos hold attention.
It was derived on 2026-07-14/15 from the channel's real YouTube Studio numbers and applied to the V6
and V5 8-minute recuts. **Every video and every short follows it.** If any older doc (including this
skill's own "preferred runtime 10–15 min" line, now superseded) conflicts, this wins.

## 0. The diagnosis that drives everything (from real Studio data)

Pulled from YouTube Studio, 2026-07-14 (channel = Byrddynasty · Understanding AI, ~137 subs):

- The channel is **alive and growing** (+16 subs / 28 days, ~1.1K views / 28 days) — **not** a quality
  problem.
- **~70% of viewers leave in the first ~30 seconds.** The best video (31 views) had avg % viewed 16%
  with a cliff in the first 30s; a weak one sat at 46s average view duration on a 15-min video.
- Traffic was **0% Browse / 0% Search / 0% External** — i.e. the algorithm was **not distributing**
  the videos at all.

**The mechanism:** YouTube only pushes a video into Browse/Suggested once it trusts the video will
hold attention. Low first-30-seconds retention → no Browse → ~single-digit views. **The channel is
retention-gated, not quality-gated.** The product was never the problem; the first 30 seconds and the
runtime were. Full strategic write-up: `jarvis-private/apps/content-creation/video-generator/
PromotionPlanning/BYRDDYNASTY-GROWTH-PLAN-2026.md`.

What we also found by watching our own videos:
- Our best-performing opening put **Terry's face on camera in the first second**; the dying ones
  opened on **dark abstract graphics** with a disembodied AI voice for ~20s (reads as "AI slop").
- Every video then sagged at ~0:17–0:40 into the same boilerplate: **"I'm an avatar… he spent 38
  years… on this channel we keep asking one question…"** — a bio + channel-refrain + thesis block that
  deflated the hook. That block is the single biggest retention leak we had.

## 1. The runtime rule: ~8 minutes

**Target every video at ~8 minutes** (acceptable 7:30–9:00). Reasons:
1. **Strangers give an unknown channel ≤8 minutes, not 15.** Long-form is a *trust-gated privilege* —
   people reserve 15–20 min for creators they already know. At low subs, a 14-min video fights the
   retention math on hard mode.
2. **% viewed is what YouTube rewards**, and % viewed is structurally higher on a tight 8-min cut than
   a 15-min one carrying the same argument.
3. **8:00 also clears the mid-roll-ad threshold** (nice for later monetization; not the point now).

Recut existing 13–15 min videos to ~8 by trimming — keep every *verified fact*, cut redundancy,
example-parades, and throat-clearing. (V6 went 15:29→8:32; V5 went 13:00→8:30.)

## 2. The cold-open template (face-first) — every video, no exceptions

The opening exists to give the viewer **a reason to keep watching** by creating tension they can't
resolve alone. Structure:

1. **0:00 — FACE FIRST.** Terry's avatar ON CAMERA from frame one, delivering the hook. Never open on a
   dark abstract graphic. (You may punch in a 2–3s supporting graphic *beside/over* the face, but the
   face is present.) A human face stops the scroll and reframes "AI voice" as "a person is talking."
2. **~0:00–0:20 — THE HOOK.** The single most provocative concrete stake, as a **paradox** where
   possible (see §3). A number, a story, a contradiction.
3. **~0:20 — THE AVATAR JOKE (one line).** The witty self-ID — *"I am an avatar for Dr. Terry Byrd —
   he writes every word, I just say them…"* It disarms the AI-voice objection with personality. **Keep
   this. Cut everything else about the bio.**
4. **~0:20–0:35 — RE-OPEN THE LOOP.** End the intro on a **named question**, not the thesis.

> **DELETE FOREVER from openings:** the "38 years" bio paragraph, "on this channel we keep asking one
> question," "Welcome back to Understanding AI," "today we're going to explore / talk about…" — every
> line that tells the viewer the video hasn't started yet. It has. *Be* started.

Proven examples: V6 = "An AI took the exam that licenses American doctors — and beat them… Would you
let it treat someone you love?"; V5 = "A lawyer walked into federal court with a brief full of cases…
not one of them existed… he'd sworn they were real."

## 3. HOW MUCH TO REVEAL IN A HOOK — the curiosity-gap rule (use this forever)

This is the reasoning behind the hook. Most people get it backwards.

### Core principle: hooks work by OPENING GAPS, not by HIDING information
Attention is protected by **unresolved tension**, not by withholding. (Loewenstein's *curiosity gap*:
curiosity is the feeling of a gap between what you know and what you want to know — and **you have to
know something concrete to even feel the gap.**) Give too little and there's no gap; the viewer isn't
intrigued, just uninformed — and they leave. So the question is never "how much did I reveal?" It is:
**"After this, does the viewer have a question they genuinely can't answer on their own?"** If yes, you
can reveal a lot and still hold them.

### Reveal FACTS freely; withhold MEANING
Sort every sentence of a hook into two columns:
- **HAND them (reveal):** facts, events, numbers, the *situation*. These build credibility and tension.
- **WITHHOLD (the payoff):** the explanation, the mechanism, the verdict, the twist, the resolution.
  This is what they stay 8 minutes to receive.

Example (V6): reveal = "it's catastrophically wrong on ~1 in 10 hard questions / in the same confident
voice / you can't tell which." Withhold = *how* that's possible (the loss function), the twist (humans
hallucinate more), who decides the acceptable failure rate, what to do about it.

### Prefer a PARADOX — it's self-sealing
- A plain fact ("An AI beat doctors on the licensing exam") is a **closed loop** — the viewer can
  resolve it themselves ("AI is good at tests, got it") and leave.
- A paradox ("…beat doctors, but 1 in 10 answers a physician can't call safe, in the same confident
  voice, and you can't tell which") is an **open loop** — the viewer *cannot* resolve the contradiction
  without you.
Adding information didn't spoil the fact; it **un-closed** it. **More information that deepens a
contradiction increases retention; more information that resolves it kills retention.** Same words,
opposite effect.

### The precise boundary: REVEAL UP TO THE QUESTION, STOP BEFORE THE ANSWER
Name the questions the hook raises; do not answer them. The moment you explain the *why*, you've spent
the video. ❌ "…the reason is language models have no truth term, so they optimize for plausibility…"
hands over the intellectual payoff — loop closed, why stay?

### Loop-naming vs agenda-setting (they look alike; they're opposite)
- ❌ **Agenda-setting:** "Today we'll talk about AI in medicine and look at some studies." → announces a
  *topic*. A table of contents. No tension.
- ✅ **Loop-naming:** "how that's possible — and who gets to decide what we do about it." → crystallizes
  the *specific unresolved tension* into a question. A cliffhanger.
Naming a sharp question is one of the strongest ways to END a cold open. Announcing a topic is one of
the weakest. This is why "Today: how that's possible, and who decides" is GOOD while "today we're going
to explore…" is BANNED — one is a gap-pointer, the other is procedural.

### Two tests to run on any hook
1. **Prediction test:** Could a smart viewer accurately guess your conclusion from the hook?
   - Yes → you revealed the answer; pull it back.
   - They can't even guess the *question* → too vague; add concrete stakes.
   - They know exactly what's at stake but can't predict the answer → **perfect.**
2. **Fact-vs-meaning test:** Sort every hook sentence — fact/event/number (safe to give) vs
   interpretation/verdict/mechanism (withhold). If your hook contains *meaning*, you're spending the
   payoff early.

**One-line summary:** *Give them the locked door and let them see it's locked. Do not hand them the key.*

## 4. Retention THROUGH the video (not just the open)
- **End every scene on a pull** — a question, a reversal, a "here's the part nobody quotes." Never end a
  scene on a fully closed thought.
- **Plant a mid-video reversal** (~40–55% mark) to re-hook the natural fade point. (V6: "the humans
  hallucinate *more*." V5: "the tool didn't fail — the lawyers did.")
- **A new visual beat every 3–5s**; no static hold >5s (the QC gate enforces it). Vary the register.
- **Save the thesis/mechanism for the middle-to-late scene it belongs to** — the open only names it.

---

## 5. Shorts: 2 per video (the distribution wedge)
Shorts **bypass the cold-start wall** that long-form is stuck behind, so they're the fastest path to
subs for a small channel. **Every 8-min video gets 2 shorts (~60s, 9:16):**
- Terry records each short's VO in HeyGen on a blank screen; the operator builds the 9:16 short by
  **recutting the MAIN video's own visuals** (scenes + citation cards) to that VO, **burned-in
  captions** (most watch muted), ending on the title lockup + a "WATCH THE FULL VIDEO ▸" + SUBSCRIBE.
- Pick **2 distinct angles** so they don't cannibalize (e.g. story/mechanism vs thesis/verdict).
- Same hook rules as §3 apply to the first *second* of a short — even harder (swipe test).
See the V5 build: `SHORTS-V5.md` + `hyperframes-shorts/SHORTS-BUILD-SPEC.md`.

## 6. Packaging (reinforces retention by earning the click honestly)
- **Titles:** stakes + curiosity-gap; the punchier framings out-performed the cerebral ones 5–8× in our
  data. A/B two.
- **Thumbnails:** face + ≤6 words + one focal idea; dark navy/gold/cream system; no red-arrow chrome.
- **Chapters, pinned engagement-question comment, end-screen subscribe** every time.
- Prime **external warm traffic** (newsletter + one Reddit post + one X thread per video) — 0% external
  was our widest-open door.

**Provenance:** V6 "When a Hallucination Could Kill You" and V5 "The Lawyer Who Trusted ChatGPT" are the
first two builds on this standard (`*-8MIN.*` files beside each original; `DECISIONS-8MIN.md` per video).
