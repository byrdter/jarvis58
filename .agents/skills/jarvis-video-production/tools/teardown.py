Teardown — implements RETENTION-AND-HOOKS.md §7.6. The second half of the outlier scan.

`outlier-scan.py` finds WHICH videos out-travelled their own distribution. This finds
out WHY: it pulls a proven video apart into a structural spec — cold open verbatim,
beat map, pacing curve, where the loop is named, where the reversal lands — so the
shape can be fused (§7.2), not cloned.

    python3 teardown.py <url|video-id>          # one video
    python3 teardown.py --from-outliers 5       # top 5 candidates in outliers.csv
    python3 teardown.py <url> --refresh         # ignore cache

Writes teardowns/<id>.md: EVIDENCE (mechanical, from this script) followed by an
ANALYSIS template (judgment, filled in by the agent reading the file). The split is
deliberate — the script never guesses at intent, and the template keeps every teardown
comparable to every other one.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: it does not tell you to make the same video. Per §7.2 cloning a
single outlier puts us head-to-head with a winner on a bigger channel. The output is
raw material for a FUSION, and the §7.4 caveat applies — these are 15-27 min videos on
30K-900K-sub channels; borrow the shape, not the runtime.

Captions only (yt-dlp auto-subs, free). No download, no Whisper, no API keys.
Cache lives in raw/teardown/ beside this script.

ANALYSIS = """## ANALYSIS — fill this in from the evidence above (do NOT skip; this is the deliverable)

Answer from the transcript, quoting timestamps. "Unclear" is a valid answer — a guess is not.

**1. Hook shape.** Which §7.4 shape is the title/open? *ceiling · mechanism · consensus-is-wrong ·
negation-of-assumed-truth · debunk · public-reversal · insider-defection · announcement (news).*
If it's an announcement, note that it broke out DESPITE the register, and say what carried it.

**2. Fact-vs-meaning sort (§3).** List what the cold open GIVES (events, numbers, situation) against
what it WITHHOLDS (mechanism, verdict, resolution). A hook that leaks meaning early is a
counter-example worth recording, not a template.

**3. Paradox test.** State the open loop as one sentence the viewer cannot resolve alone. If you
can't, the video held on something else — say what (authority? production? proof-by-demo?).

**4. Loop named at.** Timestamp where the question gets named, and whether it is answered within
30s (spent) or carried (held). Compare against §2's ~0:20–0:35.

**5. Reversal.** Timestamp + one line. Is there a real turn, or does the argument run monotone?

**6. Beat cadence.** Seconds between distinct beats, from the beat map and pacing curve. Note any
stretch >90s without a new beat and whether anything else carried it there.

**7. TRANSFERABLE STRUCTURE.** The point of the whole exercise: 3–5 bullets stating the structural
move — not the topic. "Opens on a number that contradicts the title" is transferable; "talks about
scaling laws" is not.

**8. FUSION CANDIDATES (§7.2).** 2–3 fusions of THIS concept with another *independently proven*
outlier from `outliers.csv`. Each must be statable as a contradiction (§3). Naming the second parent
and its score is mandatory — fusing with an unproven idea is how a dead concept gets built.

**9. DO NOT IMPORT.** What worked here only because of their channel size, runtime, or authority.
§7.4: these run 15–27 min on 30K–900K-sub channels; §1's 8-minute rule is not up for renegotiation
at 137 subs.
