# Obsidian Manager Skill

**Purpose:** Manage JARVIS's Obsidian vault - organize content, search across domains, create daily notes, and maintain vault structure

**When to Use:** For vault organization, searching previous work, creating notes, or managing domain folders

**Vault Location:** `/Volumes/ORICO/jarvis/obsidian-vault/`

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Daily Note Management

**Create Today's Note:**
- Use template from `templates/daily-note.md`
- Save to `daily-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Include date, idea sections, task checklist

**Find Recent Notes:**
- Search `daily-notes/` for recent entries
- Extract ideas tagged for JARVIS to process
- Identify action items across domains

### 2. Domain Organization

**Domain Structure:**
```
investments/        - Portfolio reports, analysis, decisions
content-creation/   - YouTube, LinkedIn, X, thumbnails
research/          - Daily digests, insights, papers
presentations/     - Slides, templates
documentation/     - SOPs, diagrams, guides
video-production/  - Video projects, B-roll
productivity/      - Calendar, tasks, email
```

**Organization Tasks:**
- File content in correct domain folders
- Create domain-specific notes
- Link related content across domains
- Tag appropriately for discoverability

### 3. Search & Retrieval

**Search Across Vault:**
- Use grep/ripgrep for content search
- Search by tags: `#youtube-script`, `#portfolio-report`, etc.
- Find references to specific topics
- Identify connections between domains

**Common Searches:**
```bash
# Find all portfolio reports
grep -r "#portfolio-report" /Volumes/ORICO/jarvis/obsidian-vault/

# Find investment decisions
grep -r "BUY\|SELL" /Volumes/ORICO/jarvis/obsidian-vault/investments/

# Find content ideas
grep -r "#content-idea" /Volumes/ORICO/jarvis/obsidian-vault/
```

### 4. Content Creation

**Create from Templates:**
- Daily note → `templates/daily-note.md`
- YouTube script → `templates/youtube-script.md`
- Portfolio report → `templates/portfolio-report.md`

**Save to Correct Location:**
- Investment reports → `investments/reports/`
- YouTube scripts → `content-creation/youtube/`
- Research digests → `research/daily-digests/`

### 5. Cross-Domain Intelligence

**Link Related Content:**
- Investment insights → Content ideas
- Research findings → Investment decisions
- Performance data → Social media posts

**Example:**
```markdown
Portfolio gained 5% this month
→ LinkedIn post: "How Asset Revesting outperformed..."
→ YouTube video: "My ETF strategy results..."
→ Research note: "Why this approach worked..."
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Can't find recent content
- Check file naming follows conventions
- Verify saved to correct domain folder
- Search by tags if filename unknown

**Issue:** Template not found
